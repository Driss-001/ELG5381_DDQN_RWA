# ELG5381_DDQN_RWA
Optical Network Project using Optical-RL Gym and branching DQN to incorporate DQN and DDQN for RWA

## Description

Working with Python 3.7-3.9, the environment uses stable-baseline3 2.0 and cuda 11.6 to train a model using an Nvidia gpu.
Since the observation space is multidimensional branching dqn agent is used

## Requirements
The results of this project were done using a virtual environment running on python 3.7, the modules installed are featured in requirements.txt

## Citation 
Modified crucial files from  [Optical RL-Gym](https://github.com/carlosnatalino/optical-rl-gym) for the environment to work(with gpu support) on stable-baselines3
