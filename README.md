# ELG5381_DDQN_RWA
Optical Network Project using Optical-RL Gym and branching DQN to incorporate DQN and DDQN for RWA

## Description

Working with Python 3.7-3.9, the environment uses stable-baseline3 2.0 and cuda 11.6 to train a model using an Nvidia gpu.
Since the observation space is multidimensional branching dqn agent is used
